<p> Episode 4 – Line of Hypocrisy (1)
</p><p> A meteor shower was pouring down in the starry sky. It was a sight that anyone would admire, but not Yoo Jonghyuk.
</p><p> 「 It is starting. 」
</p><p> The meteor shower was the precursor to the third main scenario starting. Now Seoul would be destroyed one by one according to the scenario.
</p><p> Yoo Jonghyuk looked up at the sky before bowing his head and looking at the Han River.
</p><p> The landscape around Dongho Bridge was quite desolate since the large group of ichthyosaurs had recently moved downstream.
</p><p> 「 It was too much. 」
</p><p> It had already been three days since Kim Dokja entered Han River. It might’ve been too much to demand that he catch the ichthyosaur at the first level.
</p><p> 「Indeed, it would be hard for me to catch an ichthyosaur in three days. 」
</p><p> But it would be impossible to take him if he couldn’t do this much. If he couldn’t even do this much, it would only hinder Yoo Jonghyuk.
</p><p> 「 A prophet isn’t a big deal. 」
</p><p> Yoo Jonghyuk closed his eyes with disappointment. He would go on his own again. Without any companions.
</p><p> It wasn’t a big deal. He had been alone all this time.
</p><p> 「 This time I will definitely change it. 」
</p><p> Yoo Jonghyuk turned around.
</p><p> But maybe he had turned away too soon.
</p><p> * * *
</p><p> “Wait...!”
</p><p> [W-What?]
</p><p> I blinked several times but could only see a grey-white ceiling. I was still inside the ichthyosaur. I turned my head and saw the surprised Bihyung.
</p><p> “...I had a dream.”
</p><p> [Ohu, are you trying to raise curiosity? It isn’t bad?]
</p><p> I didn’t mean to do such a thing but I didn’t mind the misunderstanding.
</p><p> [A few constellations want you to move to a new place quickly.]
</p><p> I used 500 coins to buy the Ellain Forest’s Vital Force to help me sleep. I thought it was too dangerous to move while exhausted.
</p><p> The Ellain Forest’s Vital Force quickly recovered fatigue and wounds in exchange for two hours of sleep. In other words, it was an expensive item.
</p><p> “...I really want to go out.”
</p><p> I talked to myself while stretching my body. The dream I just had was still clear. Maybe it wasn’t a dream.
</p><p> <i>Kwajijijik!</i> </p><p> I heard the sound of an electric current scattering and Bihyung disappeared without a word. Maybe he went to do his job.
</p><p> I sighed with relief.
</p><p> The stream contract with the dokkaebi. It was a gamble that I never would’ve attempted if I hadn’t known about Bihyung from Ways of Survival. But I did it with surprising calm. I never succeeded in any contracts in ‘real life.’
</p><p> [The exclusive skill, ‘Fourth Wall’ is in use.]
</p><p> ...This was real. I inserted strength to my right hand holding the thorn. I really thought this world was reality.
</p><p> [A few constellations want you to act.]
</p><p> Well, there was no time to worry about it. I swung the thorn as hard as I could at the stomach wall that lost its elasticity. At the same time, there was the sound of something collapsed and water pouring out. I plunged into Han River.
</p><p> “Puah!”
</p><p> Fortunately, I didn’t see any other ichthyosaurs. Small seawater species approached with curiosity but no hostility was felt. Not all creatures would attack humans.
</p><p> Dongho Bridge was over there.
</p><p> I used a piece of the ichthyosaur corpse as a floatation device and made my way towards dry land.
</p><p> My skin was cold from the cold water but I couldn’t worry about it. After 30 minutes of swimming, my hand reached land.
</p><p> [A few constellations are nervous looking at you.]
</p><p> Normally, danger would immediately come after this message popped up.
</p><p> [The constellation ‘Abyssal Black Flame Dragon’ is making an insidious smile.]
</p><p> It was a pity for the constellations but something bad wouldn’t happen to me. It was because I already knew the dangers.
</p><p> [You have entered the region of the second main scenario.]
</p><p> [The land in the scenario area is deeply polluted.]
</p><p> [Be careful about your breathing and move underground as quickly as possible.]
</p><p> The message said this but in fact, I shouldn’t be on the ground from the moment this scenario started.
</p><p> Why? Look at my skin now.
</p><p> [You have been exposed to poisonous fog.]
</p><p> The skin touched by the violet fog turned black.
</p><p> <i>Kyahh!</i> </p><p> Once I followed the source of the fog with my eyes, I saw a monster making terrible cries.
</p><p> It was a massive monster over 30 metres big. This fog was the fart of the grade 7 monster, ‘great poisonous rhinoceros.’ The rhino snorted and confronted a monster in the fog, which seemed to be an insect king species based on the shadow.
</p><p> <i>Kuaaaah...</i> </p><p> The struggle in this new world wasn’t just for humans. The monsters were also fighting for their homes.
</p><p> I moved while holding my breath as much as possible.
</p><p> They were grade 7 monsters like the ichthyosaur but I couldn’t do with them right now. In the first place, I could kill the sea commander because I was prepared.
</p><p> [You have used the Ellain Monkey’s Lungs.]
</p><p> The monkey’s lungs was an item I bought in advance that could be used as a substitute for an air purifier for 20 minutes.
</p><p> [A few constellations admire your readiness!]
</p><p> The aboveground station, Oksu Station had already bee destroyed. The nearest underground station from here was ‘Gumho Station.’ Maybe the others had moved there.
</p><p> I moved quickly while avoided the small species that were eating the corpses. I only had 20 minutes, so I needed to move as quickly as possible while securing supplies.
</p><p> The first thing I needed was clothes. My outerwear was melted by the ichthyosaur’s fluids so it was necessary. Of course, there were many of them all around but... I felt uncomfortable.
</p><p> ...It couldn’t be helped. I searched some bodies and grabbed clothes that roughly fit. Then I headed to a nearby convenience store.
</p><p> I grabbed a few plastic bags and swept in food randomly. Food would be a valuable trading item after going underground.
</p><p> I filled three or four bags like this. It seemed that the colour of the monkey’s lungs was becoming increasingly darker. There wasn’t much time left.
</p><p> Then I heard someone’s voice.
</p><p> “Help...help me.”
</p><p> There was someone still alive? A young woman was lying down in a corner. The poisoning was progressing on the surface of the skin, but the toxic condition wasn’t severe due to the mask she was wearing. Her jacket was half removed and a bit of her skirt was torn.
</p><p> “Are you okay? Can you stand?”
</p><p> “Uhhhh...”
</p><p> Was there such an extra in Ways of Survival? I wanted to take a closer look but I didn’t have enough time. I picked up the woman and ran to Gumho Station.
</p><p> I turned and a side street appeared. Now the distance to Gumho Station was 100 metres in a straight line. I breathed in and started to run with all my strength. I could see the Exit 3 sign in the distance.
</p><p> ....Closed. Then on the other side?
</p><p> There was a fire shutter down at every exit due to the disaster situation. I could break the shutter with his thorn but if I did it wrong, the people inside might be damaged.
</p><p> “E-Exit 4...”
</p><p> Unexpectedly, the woman I was carrying was helpful. I ran towards Exit 4. Then I found a fire shutter that was rolling down. I placed the thorn in the gap of the shutter that was trying to close. Somebody yelled out.
</p><p> “Shit, what is this?”
</p><p> “Open the door.”
</p><p> “N-No! You can’t come in! Go away!”
</p><p> “There is a wounded person.”
</p><p> “We are already in a full state! We don’t need any more people!”
</p><p> It was full of people? Strange. Was there such a development?
</p><p> “I don’t care about that.”
</p><p> I used the thorn as a lever and lifted the shutter as hard as possible. Since I used the coins to increase my strength to level 10, I now had the strength of half a dozen adult males.
</p><p> “Uwaaaaack!”
</p><p> There was a loud sound and the people on the other side of the shutter became nervous.
</p><p> “R-Run away!”
</p><p> The scared men escaped into the darkness of the underground passage. I entered the station safely, lowered the shutter and put the girl down on the floor.
</p><p> [You have entered the safety zone.]
</p><p> The poisonous fog didn’t come down to the underground area. There was no possible scientific explanation. It was just because of the ‘scenario.’
</p><p> “Put this in your mouth.”
</p><p> I took off the woman’s mask and handed over the monkey’s lungs. It wouldn’t completely cure her but it would have a neutralizing effect.
</p><p> “Umm...”
</p><p> A faint groan emerged from the mouth of the woman. The woman who was abandoned.
</p><p> I suddenly wondered about her information. This woman, it was likely that she had died in the original development.
</p><p> A voice was heard as I was about to use Character List.
</p><p> “There he is!”
</p><p> Light from a flashlight approached in the darkness. My eyes narrowed as I saw men holding metal pipes.
</p><p> [The constellation ‘Prisoner of the Golden Headband’ frowns at the appearance of the uninvited people.]
</p><p> A big man in the middle opened his mouth. His body was well balanced so he must be a strong person.
</p><p> “Who are you?”
</p><p> At this moment, I was strangely struck dumb. What should I say when this happened? I thought for a moment before speaking like Yoo Jonghyuk.
</p><p> “Kim Dokja.”
</p><p> “...Kim Dokja? That is your name?”
</p><p> “Yes.”
</p><p> “Who asked that? What is this bastard?”
</p><p> It was a more difficult question.
</p><p> “U-Uh! That woman...”
</p><p> One of the men found the woman beside me and shone the flashlight on her.’
</p><p> “What, isn’t that woman from the marginalized group? Didn’t you come back with her?”
</p><p> “T-That is...”
</p><p> The man’s flashlight moved in a harassing manner near the woman’s waist.
</p><p> “...Ha, so it was like that. Cute guys. Why did you do that without Hyung-nim’s permission?”
</p><p> “Hehe. I’m sorry.”
</p><p> “No, of course Cheolsoo hyung-nim should be first...hehe, I was going to do that.”
</p><p> Cheolsoo? Cheolsoo. Was there a character by that name? I couldn’t remember. He must be nothing, as opposed to how he looked.
</p><p> “Hey, hand that woman over to us...huh? What is that?”
</p><p> The flashlight shone on the convenience store bags on the floor. It was okay to escape the crisis but the flow was turning out bad.
</p><p> “Leave that as well. Then you can live.”
</p><p> To be exact, it wasn’t good for these guys, not me.
</p><p> [The constellation ‘Prisoner of the Golden Headband’ is annoyed at these people.]
</p><p> [The constellation ‘Demon-like Judge of Fire’ is angry with the injustice occurring.]
</p><p> [A bounty scenario has occurred at the request of the constellations!]

</p><p> I thought it would be like this. Poor bastards. I got up while holding the thorn.
</p><p> There weren’t any minors in the constellations right?
</p><p> I hoped so. It was because it was now the adult broadcasting time.</p><p class="box-notification fs-17"> Search the <b>NovelFire.net</b> website on Google to access chapters of novels early and in the highest quality. </p>

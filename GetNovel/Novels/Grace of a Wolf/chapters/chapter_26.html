<h1>Grace: A Suspicious Hand</h1>
<p> A series of knocks jerks me out of a dream involving a lot of naked skin, among other details I have no business recalling. I wipe a trail of drool from my cheek. "Gross."
</p><p> Another knock.
</p><p> "Come in." My voice comes out scratchy. Clearing my throat, I sit up on my bed, wondering who it is.
</p><p> My entire body stiffens as Andrew steps through the doorway. His limp brown hair falls into his eyes and something about his expression is strange, but what catches my attention is the pillow in his hands.
</p><p> "What are you doing here?" Despite him obviously being here to deliver what I need, the words come out defensive. I was glad to see he was alive earlier, but it doesn’t mean I wanted to see him in person. I just didn’t want to recognize another body on the pile.
</p><p> "Delivering this." He holds up the pillow like a peace offering, but his eyes are intense as they look me over. "Lycan King’s orders."
</p><p> My fingers twitch with the urge to snatch it from him.
</p><p> "Just toss it over here," I say, waving airily at the other side of my bed, aiming for nonchalance despite how desperately I want it. My neck hurts from the impromptu nap I took without one.
</p><p> Andrew hesitates, his eyes darting around the room. "You... Are you okay?"
</p><p> My eyes narrow at Andrew’s question. Something’s off about his visit—the Lycan King wouldn’t send him of all people to deliver a pillow, would he? Fenris should recognize him from their encounter during the Mate Hunt.
</p><p> Then again, I’m acting like the Lycan King cares about me. He probably hasn’t thought twice about a wolf as insignificant as Andrew. Even if Rafe came in here, I’m sure he wouldn’t bat an eye...
</p><p> Then I remember yesterday. Okay, maybe not Rafe. The Lycan King doesn’t seem to like him very much for some reason.
</p><p> "I’m as fine as anyone can be in this situation." Despite trying to sound neutral, my words come out clipped. My tongue presses against my teeth, stopping the automatic ’how are you?’ from escaping. Old habits die hard, but I’m not about to pretend we’re friends.
</p><p> He’s alive. Great. I don’t need to know more details.
</p><p> Andrew’s feet shuffle against the floor as he takes a step forward. Then another. His arms wrap tighter around my pillow, pressing it against his chest like a shield. The sight of it makes my fingers curl into my palms. That’s <i>my</i> pillow, and now it’s going to smell like him.
</p><p> Scents aren’t something that usually bother me, and I’ve always found shifters to be a little odd with how finicky they can be about them. But now I get it. I don’t want to smell Andrew in my bed while I sleep. Ew.
</p><p> I imagine burning the pillow, but no, it didn’t do anything wrong. It’s a victim.
</p><p>"Rafe’s worried about you, you know."</p><p> A harsh laugh bursts from my throat before I can stop it. Of course that’s why Andrew’s here. He’s always been Rafe’s right-hand gofer.
</p><p> His face tightens, his mouth curving down at the corners. "He’s been busy, but he’s still taking the time to look after you."
</p><p> "Pfft." Pressing my lips together before another scoff comes out, I focus on taking three deep breaths through my nose. Once I’m sure I won’t laugh in Andrew’s face, I reply, "Rafe has bigger problems to deal with. He’s Alpha now, right? He should focus on running his pack and getting on the Lycan King’s good side before more of you die. And he already has a mate, so he has no business looking after his ex, don’t you think? Only a sleaze would do that behind her back."
</p><p> The words come so easily now, without a twinge of pain.
</p><p> A warm rush of satisfaction spreads through my chest. The words came out without a single crack in my voice, without the slightest tremor. Look at me, already over Rafe. Maybe trauma is good for something after all.
</p><p> "You don’t mean that." Andrew scowls, still holding my precious pillow hostage. "The pack’s a mess right now, but we still want to take care of you."
</p><p> The declaration hits like a slap. My mouth falls open as I stare at him, wondering if I heard right. "<i>Take care</i> of me?" Did I wake up in a parallel universe?
</p><p> "Yes, we—"
</p><p> "Ellie told the Lycan Beta she would personally destroy me on the Lycan King’s command. She said harboring humans in the pack is illegal. Now you’re trying to tell me you all want to <i>take care</i> of me?" My eyes narrow. "Or do you mean you’re going to kill me?"
</p><p> "What? No!" Andrew’s face pales. "Rafe would never—"
</p><p> "Uh-huh."
</p><p> He growls, finally tossing the pillow at me. It lands on the floor, just inches from the bed. "For your information, Ellie’s the one who suggested we help you."
</p><p> A burst of laughter escapes my throat. "Ellie? Wanting to help me?" I shake my head, unable to help the hysterical giggles from bubbling up. How absurd. "You’ll have to do better than that. I may be human, but I’m not an idiot."
</p><p> Andrew’s jaw clenches. He opens his mouth to argue, but I cut him off before he can.
</p><p> "Save it. I don’t want to hear any more lies." I point at the pillow on the floor. "Thanks for the delivery, but you can go now. I’m sure you have more important things to do than pretend to care about me."
</p><p> He sighs, vigorously scratching at his hair as he scowls at me. "You’re being so obstinate. Ellie knows you’re in danger, and she knows Rafe wants to keep you safe. We all decided to help you out."
</p><p> "Stop." I hold up my hand, needing a moment to process this absurdity. My eyes narrow as I study Andrew’s earnest expression. Either he’s the world’s best actor, or he actually believes what he’s saying.
</p><p> A chill runs down my spine as I realize what this means. They think I’m stupid enough to fall for this. Maybe Andrew’s serious, but I <i>know</i> Ellie isn’t.
</p><p> I point over his shoulder at the door. "You do realize there’s a Lycan guard right outside? He’s heard every word."
</p><p> Andrew shakes his head, a hint of triumph in his eyes. "They’re all gathering with the king right now. There’s no Lycan on guard. Just pack."
</p><p> My heart skips a beat. The way he says it, like it’s supposed to reassure me, makes my skin crawl. But... is it so bad to take this hand they’re offering?
</p><p> Ellie definitely has an ulterior motive, but wouldn’t our interests align in this case? She’ll want me out of Rafe’s life, and that’s <i>exactly</i> what I’m hoping for. Relying on the fickle mindset of the Lycan King is not a great way to survive to old age.
</p><p> My thumb finds its way between my teeth as I study Andrew’s face. The earnest look in his eyes makes my stomach twist. Either he’s telling the truth, or he’s been thoroughly fooled by whatever game Ellie’s playing.
</p><p> "Fine." I drop my hand to my lap. There’s no harm in listening to what they have to say; it doesn’t mean I’m going to do it. "What’s this brilliant plan you all cooked up?"</p>

<h1>Caine: Strange (II)</h1>
<p><strong>CAINE</strong></p><p> The house Marsh leads me to is no different from the others.
</p><p> Marsh pushes the door open without knocking. No courtesy, not even a perfunctory tap. Interesting.
</p><p> Inside feels bare, even more than a model home. There are no photos. No art. Nothing personal. Even Halloway’s pretentious display of wealth had some semblance of life to it. This place resembles a vacant rental property.
</p><p> There is furniture, though.
</p><p> Jack-Eye emerges from what must be the kitchen with Elizabeth trailing behind. His shoulder brushes against hers, a short-lived point of contact, and it speaks volumes. The faint whiff of her scent clings to him.
</p><p> He catches my eye and winks, that insufferable smirk playing at the corner of his mouth.
</p><p> "Where are the other two?" I ask Jack-Eye, scanning the barren living room.
</p><p> "Upstairs." Jack-Eye jerks his thumb toward the ceiling. "The wizard doesn’t like being around shifters. Gets the shakes." He drops his voice to a mock whisper. "I think we scare him."
</p><p> Elizabeth chuckles.
</p><p> "And Andrew?"
</p><p> "In another bedroom."
</p><p> Confined. Good.
</p><p> Marsh clears his throat. "If that’s all, High Alpha, I’ll return to Alpha Halloway. We still have the banquet to arrange—"
</p><p> I wave him off with a dismissive hand. His eagerness to leave is palpable, but I don’t think it’s from my display of dominance earlier. He seems more comfortable now that we’re here.
</p><p> Letting my gaze wander to Elizabeth, I ask, "Is this your home?"
</p><p> "Yes, High Alpha." There’s a tightness around her eyes, and the faint scent of deception. "I hope it meets your standards."
</p><p> I cast another glance around the clinical space. "It seems rather large for a single woman."
</p><p> "It serves multiple purposes." Her eyes don’t quite meet mine. "Guest lodging when needed. Work space when the den gets crowded." She gestures vaguely toward a closed door. "I have a home office through there."
</p><p> The practical explanation doesn’t align with the emptiness. A multi-purpose space would show signs of its various uses. This place resembles a blank canvas.
</p><p> Strange. My assumption they brought me here in order to show their legitimacy seems... wrong.
</p><p> If they wanted to present their pack life as an acceptable twist of shifter society, it’s a little too strange. Almost as if their families live elsewhere, and their presence here is little more than a performance.
</p><p> There is too little life in this place. They have another purpose for inviting me here.
</p><p> Fenris grunts. <i>Your brain has become exceptional since accepting Grace.</i></p><p> "I’m surprised you aren’t mated with a few pups running around by now," I tell Elizabeth, leaning into a side of me I rarely access. My lips curve into a friendly smile, and I can see Jack-Eye twitch.
</p><p> He’s always uncomfortable when I act, as he calls it, <i>normal</i>.
</p><p> Elizabeth glances away. "Not everyone follows the same path, High Alpha. I like my work."
</p><p> "Of course." I keep my tone light, but file away her reaction. Another piece in this strange pack’s puzzle.
</p><p> Jack-Eye clears his throat. "Elizabeth has been kind enough to offer her home instead of putting us up at the den. Isn’t she sweet, Caine?"
</p><p> "Very."
</p><p> Elizabeth’s blush is expected, and Jack-Eye slides an arm around her waist. She leans into him naturally.
</p><p> For a woman who claims she would prefer work to pups, her body language says otherwise. She seems a little dazed by my beta’s affection.
</p><p> "Would you like to see where you’ll be staying?" she asks, with a shy glance toward Jack-Eye. "There are four bedrooms. One is for you, and your beta has already settled your guests into the others. The last is mine."
</p><p> Jack-Eye grins, pulling her a little closer as he says, "Don’t worry, boss. You won’t have to share."
</p><p>His charm is irritating and inauthentic, but Elizabeth seems to love it. A soft giggle escapes her, at odds with her no-nonsense demeanor at our first meeting.</p><p> The performance is nauseating, but I keep the fake smile on my face. The moment I show any discomfort, Jack-Eye will ramp up his efforts—it’s his favorite amusement.
</p><p> If he wasn’t my beta...
</p><p><i>But he is.</i></p><p> Unfortunately.
</p><p><i>You share such a strange friendship.</i></p><p> "I believe I’ll explore the place myself, if that’s acceptable."
</p><p> Elizabeth’s eyes flicker behind me. It’s a microsecond of reaction before she plasters a bright smile on her face. "Of course, High Alpha. My home is your home."
</p><p> "We have a couple hours before this banquet, correct?"
</p><p> "Yes, High Alpha."
</p><p> "Would you mind checking with Marsh about the hospital contact I requested? I’d like regular updates about my mate’s condition."
</p><p> Elizabeth’s smile falters. A frown creases her forehead, and an acrid scent spikes off her.
</p><p> Jack-Eye spins her around with fluid grace, lifting her chin as he brushes a kiss against her lips.
</p><p> My eye twitches.
</p><p> "You’re a gem, Elizabeth," he murmurs. "Completely wasted in Fiddleback. What would they do without you?"
</p><p> Her transformation is immediate, her discomfort disappearing as she softens in my beta’s embrace.
</p><p><i>He plays her like a violin. You should take notes.</i></p><p> No.
</p><p> Jack-Eye’s manipulation is effective, but his gestures are empty, lacking true affection. Grace and I have so much more between us.
</p><p> Elizabeth remains silent for several beats, lost in whatever fantasies Jack-Eye planted with his feigned respect and admiration. Then she blinks, returning to the present moment. Her smile, when she turns back to me, seems more genuine.
</p><p> "I’ll contact Marsh right away, High Alpha. You should be getting your updates shortly."
</p><p> I nod, watching her pull out her phone and step into her supposed office. The door clicks shut behind her.
</p><p> "Subtle," I tell Jack-Eye once she’s gone.
</p><p> He shrugs, dropping the charming facade as we head upstairs. He lowers his voice. "While you were at the hospital with our new Luna, I did a sweep of this place. Nothing out of the ordinary. No obvious traps."
</p><p> "But?"
</p><p> "But there’s no way this is her actual home. No personal items, not even a spare toothbrush in the bathroom cabinet."
</p><p> I grunt. "That much was obvious."
</p><p> "Oh? And here I thought I was being clever." He rubs the back of his neck with a sigh. "Something’s off about this pack. They don’t seem dangerous, but they’re planning something. I can feel it."</p><p class="box-notification fs-17"> Search the <b>NovelFire.net</b> website on Google to access chapters of novels early and in the highest quality. </p>

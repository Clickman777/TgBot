<h1>Caine: Banquet (III)</h1>
<p><strong>CAINE</strong></p><p> Elizabeth and Marsh stand out starkly among the crowd of Fiddleback wolves. Both appear to be in their mid-twenties at most, though I would bet every last penny of my pack’s treasury Marsh is no older than twenty. The rest of the pack members present are significantly older, most well into middle age or beyond.
</p><p> No young adults. No adolescents. And, I recall, no hint of children in the territory.
</p><p> Even the most formal events typically include a range of ages—the entire pack hierarchy represented from pups to elders. Yet here, there’s a clear generational gap.
</p><p> "Your pack seems... mature," I comment, interrupting whatever Halloway was saying about their investment portfolio.
</p><p> He pauses, the champagne halfway to his lips. "I beg your pardon?"
</p><p> I gesture subtly toward the gathering. "No pups. Few young adults."
</p><p> Something flickers across his face as he grows tense. "Ah." He sets down his glass with careful precision. "We’re selective about our growth. Quality over quantity, as they say."
</p><p> "An unusual approach for wolves. Especially for a pack so intent on survival, as you say."
</p><p> "Times change, High Alpha. We’ve found that careful expansion allows us better integration with the human world." His smile returns to his face, but it’s hollow. "Our younger members are quite valuable. Elizabeth and Marsh represent the future direction of our pack."
</p><p> "Just them?"
</p><p> "There are others, of course." His tone remains light, but his scent sharpens with something acidic. "Many are traveling or occupied with responsibilities elsewhere. We don’t keep our members caged, after all."
</p><p> Jack-Eye shifts beside me, his attention fixed on Halloway with calculated intensity.
</p><p> "And your mating ceremonies?" I press. "Elizabeth mentioned hosting them here, but there seems to be a lack of candidates."
</p><p> His eyes flicker to the gardens. "Yes, well, not all mate young. Much like you, High Alpha."
</p><p> "When was your last mated pair?"
</p><p> His smile tightens. "As I’ve explained, we focus on compatibility rather than quantity."
</p><p> Elizabeth appears, her heels clicking as she whispers something in Halloway’s ear. Even with my enhanced hearing, I can’t make out the words.
</p><p> Fenris’s ears flick. <i>Me neither.</i></p><p> The Fiddlepack Alpha’s expression darkens before smoothing into neutrality once again. "If you’ll excuse me, High Alpha. A small administrative matter requires my attention. Please, enjoy the banquet. I believe it’s about time to be seated for our meal. We’ll speak privately afterward as promised."
</p><p> My phone buzzes, and I glance at the image sent. Yet another angle of a sleeping Grace.
</p><p> Jack-Eye peers over my shoulder, and I elbow him back.
</p><p> "Wait—is that what they just sent you?"
</p><p> My jaw tightens as Jack-Eye’s fingers close around my phone, yanking it from my grasp before I can react. The audacity burns through me like molten silver. No one touches what’s mine.
</p><p> "Give that back." I haven’t had a chance to zoom into Grace’s face yet.
</p><p> Jack-Eye ignores my command, scrolling through the photos with narrowed eyes. "The sun went down ages ago."
</p><p> I blink, momentarily derailed from my anger. "Say something less obvious."
</p><p> "Look." He tilts the screen toward me, finger tapping at the background. "The light is all wrong. This was taken earlier today—see how the sunlight is hitting her bedside table?"
</p><p> My blood freezes. The slant of light through the hospital window casts long shadows across Grace’s sleeping form—shadows which can’t exist after sunset.
</p><p> These aren’t explained by overhead lights.
</p><p> I snatch the phone back, examining each photo sent over the last hour.
</p><p> All identical. Same position, same light, same everything.
</p><p> "They’ve been sending the same picture repeatedly," I murmur, barely containing the growl building behind my words. "Possibly for hours."
</p><p> "It might not even be the same photo." Jack-Eye bends over my phone again, blocking my view. "See the text on Lyre’s book? It’s different every time. A little strange, too."
</p><p> Fenris growls. <i>Grace.</i></p><p> "It might be AI. You’d be surprised at how good it’s become—"
</p><p> "Jack-Eye."
</p><p> "Yeah?"
</p><p> "Shut up."
</p><p> I tap open my contacts, selecting Lyre’s number. It goes straight to voicemail.
</p><p> My pulse drums against my temples as I try again. Nothing.
</p><p> Her phone’s off. Explains why all my messages have been sitting there, unread and unanswered.
</p><p> Damn it. I should have known better than to trust someone the Fiddlebacks sent to the hospital, but I hadn’t expected them to be this rotten.
</p><p> Whatever their secret is, I’d expected it to have more political impact than anything. The pack is too small to pose a threat, even with only two Lycans in the area. Their strength is underwhelming, and I’d been arrogant.
</p><p> Of <i>course</i> they’d go for Grace. It’s the only way to cut our power off at the knees.
</p><p> Having a weakness is new to me. It’s a lesson I won’t soon forget.
</p><p> "Call the hospital," I order Jack-Eye, already striding toward the terrace doors, ready to start violence. "Find out if Grace is still there."
</p><p><i>Kill them,</i> Fenris snarls, padding behind me. His glow is brighter now, enough to hurt your eyes if you look directly at him. <i>All of them.</i></p><p> Jack-Eye’s phone is already pressed to his ear, but I don’t wait for the answer. I know what it will be.
</p><p> Fenris stalks alongside me, his ethereal blue glow intensifying with each step. <i>She’s gone. They’ve taken her. Kill them all.</i></p><p> Andrew and Thom jump forward from where they stood near the terrace doors. The Blue Mountain pup must have some insight, because he frowns when he sees me. The wizard, meanwhile, hangs his head with his signature tremble.
</p><p> "Stay back," I warn them both. They don’t have the protection of my pack link.
</p><p> The Blue Mountain pup grabs the shaking wizard and yanks him behind me. If he wasn’t a sniveling little shit, I’d be proud of his ability to assess a situation.
</p><p> Dominance rolls off me like a rogue wave, flattening the crowd to the ground and cutting off the music and soft background chatter in an instant.
</p><p> "Halloway." My eyes roam the room, but there’s no hint of their alpha anywhere. My voice booms through the crowd. "Where the fuck is Halloway?"</p>

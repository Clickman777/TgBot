<h1>Grace: Mama?!</h1>
<p> Bun burrows deeper into my lap, trembling against my chest. The cave has gone deadly silent except for her sniffles.
</p><p> "I can explain," Owen says again, taking another careful step back when Caine’s eyes lock onto him like heat-seeking missiles.
</p><p> My heart pounds, trapped somewhere between panic and a bizarre protective instinct for the toddler currently using me as a human tissue. I’ve known this child for less than a handful of hours, but the bone-crushing tension radiating from Caine makes me want to shield her with my body.
</p><p> "She’s not—we’re not—" My voice is thin. "This isn’t what it looks like."
</p><p> The words are lame, but it isn’t as if I was expecting to defend myself against a toddler calling me her mother.
</p><p> Caine’s jaw twitches. The tattoos on his skin seem to pulse darker, shadows writhing beneath his flesh. I can practically hear the calculations happening behind his stormy eyes—dates, timelines, possibilities...
</p><p> Not that there’s much to calculate.
</p><p> No. Wait. Is he really wondering if Bun could be Rafe’s...? <i>No.</i></p><p> Owen clears his throat. "Bun has no parents. None of the children do." His voice remains steady despite the death stare Caine is drilling into him. "They’re all soulspliced aberrants I rescued from various facilities. Bun is the youngest."
</p><p> It’s the most words I’ve ever heard him put together at once.
</p><p> "Soulspliced?" I echo, glancing down at the little head tucked under my chin.
</p><p> "Their souls are..." He moves his hands awkwardly. "Mixed with more than one source. Aberrants."
</p><p> Bun raises her tear-stained face to look up at me. Her features shift slightly—bunny ears pop out of her head, and whiskers sprout her cheeks again. Then they’re gone.
</p><p> It happens so fast I might have imagined it if I hadn’t seen it multiple times already.
</p><p>"MAMA!" she wails again, louder this time, pressing her face back against my collarbone.</p><p> Caine’s expression darkens further, if that’s even possible. His hands curl into fists at his sides.
</p><p> Jer sighs from behind us all. "Grace, you have to acknowledge it."
</p><p> Acknowledge—what? That I’m her <i>mother</i>?
</p><p> But he’s continuing, "She’ll keep repeating herself if you don’t. It’s right there—on her knee."
</p><p> I twist my head to peer down at the knee pressed against my side. It looks a little red. "Her knee?"
</p><p> "Doomed," Sara moans from behind her hands.
</p><p> Bun pulls back, her lower lip jutting out as she sniffs hard. "Mama," she whines, sounding a little more pathetic and less... loud. But there’s a promise of escalation if I don’t handle this right.
</p><p> The dark-curled boy rolls his eyes. "We know it hurts, Bun. Grace, you have to kiss it. Bun, you want Grace to kiss the owie?"
</p><p> The toddler brightens. "Mm! Mama. Hee. Mama." She kicks her leg out, proving it doesn’t hurt at all—except in her memory.
</p><p> "What’s she saying?" Lyre asks, looking way too amused by this entire situation. Her cat-slit eyes are dancing from person to person, her lips twitching every time she looks at Bun.
</p><p> "She’s saying ’owie here’," Jer translates as I kiss Bun’s knee.
</p><p> "Wait—are you saying she isn’t calling Grace mama?"
</p><p> "Huh?" The boy frowns at Lyre, crossing his arms. "Why would he call her mama? We just met her. ’Mama’ means ’owie’."
</p><p> Oh.
</p><p><i>Ohh.</i></p><p> The relief on Caine’s face is immediate and palpable, like someone just lifted an entire truck off his chest. His shoulders drop a fraction of an inch, and the murderous gleam in his eyes dims to merely threatening. He even smiles.
</p><p><i>Smiles.</i></p><p> "She’s hurt," he says, still smiling.
</p><p> I narrow my eyes in his direction, but he doesn’t seem to notice, still with an absurd tilt of his lips as he nods, as if the world is right again.
</p><p> And in a way, it is. I get it. To go from motherhood to not-motherhood in the span of three seconds, I also feel relieved. And no one’s getting murdered over a misunderstanding, so even better. But as I look down at Bun’s tearful face, at the smudge of red on her knee I’ve already kissed, there’s a tiny, sharp pang of disappointment.
</p><p> Ridiculous.
</p><p> I’ve known this child for hours, not days or years. I’m not her mother. I don’t <i>want </i>to be her mother. I’m eighteen and just escaped a pack that treated me like dirt for being human. The last thing I need is a shape-shifting toddler calling me "mama" and meaning it.
</p><p> And yet.
</p><p> For one brief, insane moment, someone needed me. Someone chose me, specifically. Not because I was convenient, or there, or because a mystical bond said so. Just... me.
</p><p> I swallow hard and force a smile. "See? Not my kid."
</p><p> My heart breaks a little.
</p><p> Bun beams, wiggling her magically better leg.
</p><p> The tension drains from the room by degrees. Jack-Eye looks like he might start breathing again. Owen’s no longer tense, though as soon as he meets Lyre’s eyes, he jerks back until he bumps into the wall.
</p><p> Unsurprisingly, Lyre looks disappointed.
</p><p> "That’s a shame," she drawls, stretching her arms over her head. "I was looking forward to the whole ’you have a secret baby’ drama. Really would’ve spiced things up."
</p><p> Caine glowers at her, but she doesn’t even look at him. I used to think she was suicidally stupid to stand up to the man, but after seeing her fling him across the room? I’m starting to see there’s a <i>lot</i> more to Lyre than I ever expected.
</p><p> Bun turns her face back toward me, rubbing her nose against my neck. I wrap my arms around her, careful not to squeeze too tight. There’s something uncomfortably right about holding her. Like my arms were designed for exactly this.
</p><p> "So all these kids are... what did you call them? Soulspliced?" I ask Owen, desperately needing to change the subject before I think too hard about the maternal instincts apparently lying dormant inside me.
</p><p> He nods, relieved to be discussing something other than perceived parenthood. Lyre takes a step closer to him, and he stiffens further. I wasn’t sure it was actually possible. "Yes. Their soul has the essence of multiple souls within it, which is considered—"

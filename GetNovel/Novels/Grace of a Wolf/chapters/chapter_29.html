<h1>Grace: Did I Offend Him?</h1>
<p>My stomach is gnawing itself to death.</p><p>I press a hand against it, willing it to calm down as I resume pacing the perimeter of my room. Seven steps along the wall. Turn. Five steps across. Turn. Seven steps back. Turn. Five steps to the door.</p><p>I crack it open for the fifth time in twenty minutes.</p><p>The Blue Mountain shifter stands at attention, back rigid as a plank. He doesn’t even twitch as I peer around the edge of the door. His eyes remain fixed forward, as if I’m nothing but a breeze passing through the hallway.</p><p>I close the door with a sigh and press my forehead against the cool wood. My stomach clenches painfully. The mountain of breakfast from earlier features in my regrets; I should have stuffed my face while I had the chance. Or at least taken some with me.</p><p>Another cramp twists my insides. Decision made.</p><p>I yank open the door, determination straightening my spine.</p><p>"Hey! I need—"</p><p>My words die as I nearly collide with a broad chest. Not the Blue Mountain guard. The Lycan King himself stands before me, his hand raised mid-knock, a tray balanced perfectly in his other palm. The scent of lasagna and garlic bread makes my mouth water in the most unbecoming way.</p><p>His eyebrow arches, storm-gray eyes assessing as they rove over me. I take an instinctive step back, which is apparently Lycan for <em>come on in</em> because that’s precisely what he does.</p><p>Rude.</p><p> </p><p>Then again, he made it oh-so-clear I’m his prisoner, so can I really complain?</p><p>He kicks the door closed with his heel without looking, his gaze never leaving my face. "Are you comfortable?" he asks, setting the tray on my bed.</p><p>I eye him suspiciously. Personally delivering food and asking about my comfort? His behavior is on a rollercoaster again.</p><p>"I’m fantastic, thank you."</p><p>His jaw tightens. "You’re not."</p><p>"I just said I am, though?"</p><p>He grunts. "Your boyfriend will be instated as Alpha tonight."</p><p>I already know that, thanks to Andrew. "I’m sure he’s happy about it."</p><p>Another grunt, and he hasn’t moved from the side of my bed, effectively cutting me off from the food.</p><p>My stomach begs me to dive for it, but I wring my hands together, digging my nails into my skin to keep my composure. "Did you need something else?"</p><p>His eyes land on my linked hands. "How is your wrist?"</p><p>"It’s fine." It’s not, but as long as I’m not using it much, the pain is bearable. It’s the hunger killing me now, but it’s being gatekept by a Lycan with a questionable grasp on sanity.</p><p>His hand reaches out so quickly I don’t have time to flinch. My breath catches as his fingers capture a strand of my hair, letting it slide through them with unsettling fascination.</p><p>There are no nerve endings in my hair, but the action sends shivers down my spine regardless.</p><p>The lasagna’s rich aroma taunts me while my captor plays with my hair, and I’m struck again by the strangeness of this situation. Thankfully, Andrew’s coming tonight. Just a little longer and I’ll be free. For real this time.</p><p>"When were you first brought to the Blue Mountain Pack?"</p><p>I barely suppress a groan. He brings me food—which I’m dying to devour—but of course it comes with a cost. I guess I won’t be allowed to eat if I don’t answer.</p><p>He probably doesn’t remember any of what I said before, but it’s still annoying to repeat it.</p><p>"Six years ago," I answer crisply, fighting the urge to step away. Any sudden movement might upset him, and I’m not risking him taking away my food or something in retaliation.</p><p>His fingers continue their exploration, twining around the strand. "Six," he repeats, as if testing the word. "And your parents?"</p><p>"Dead," I snap. He might not remember the details of what I told him, but he should at least remember I’m an orphan, damn it.</p><p>"And he claimed you as his daughter?"</p><p>"Yes." My hands clench at my sides. "Until he didn’t, the night of the Mate Hunt."</p><p>Caine’s eyes narrow, his fingers still absently toying with my hair. "Yes, explain that again."</p><p>My patience fractures. The lasagna is right there, its cheese congealing while he plays twenty questions. "Could I maybe eat while you interrogate me? Since you brought dinner?"</p><p>His eyebrows rise, but he releases my hair and steps aside with a gesture toward the bed. "By all means."</p><p> </p><p>I move cautiously, as if approaching a sleeping predator, and perch on the edge of the mattress. The first bite of lasagna hits my tongue, and I have to stifle a moan. It’s perfect—rich tomato sauce, seasoned beef, and cheese that stretches in satisfying strings. Heaven wrapped in pasta layers.</p><p>The Blue Mountain Pack is no longer home, but the chef is great.</p><p>Caine stands uncomfortably close, looming over me as his eyes follow my fork. "Continue."</p><p>I swallow, forcing myself to eat slowly despite my hunger. "Not much to tell. I must have been drugged, because I woke up practically naked in the forest during the Mate Hunt. I guess he was trying to force me to shift. He thought I was his biological daughter and found out I wasn’t." I shrug. "Then he tossed me to the omegas."</p><p>"And how did he ’find out’?" His voice carries an edge that makes me pause mid-bite.</p><p>My brows draw together. "I told you, after the Mate Hunt. When I didn’t shift."</p><p>He circles to face me, blocking the light from the window. "Did he ever bring up shifting before?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Not even at sixteen?"</p><p>"No—oh." Staring blankly at the lasagna, I recall, "He did throw me a pretty big sweet sixteen. He would always get me a cake for my birthday, but it wasn’t usually a big party like that."</p><p>Caine frowns. "I see. How was his mood?"</p><p>The memory is clear, because the day was so special to me. "He had to leave halfway through because something came up. I didn’t think much of it because Rafe was with me." Poking my lower lip with my fork, I squint in the air, as if it’ll help me see my memory with more clarity. "He was happy when I first saw him that morning, but he was pretty subdued by evening. I thought he was just busy."</p><p>A low growl rumbles through the room and Caine spins away from me, pacing the floor. Five steps. Turn. Five steps. Turn.</p><p>I set my fork down, appetite vanishing under the weight of his agitation. He’s ruining all my meals.</p><p>"Did Brax intend to mate you with Rafe?"</p><p>The non sequitur throws me for a loop, and I blink. "No, Alpha had nothing to do with our relationship."</p><p>"Stop calling him Alpha." Caine whirls toward me, his voice sharp as a blade. "He’s not your alpha anymore."</p><p>I flinch, my shoulders hunching. "Alpha Brax," I correct myself, my voice smaller than before, "had nothing to do with our relationship."</p><p>His scowl deepens, storm clouds gathering in his eyes. "How long were you in a <em>relationship</em> with the pup?"</p><p>The way he spits the word ’relationship’ makes my skin crawl. It’s so venomous. "You mean Rafe?"</p><p>A sharp nod answers me, his jaw clenched so tight I can see the muscle jumping beneath his skin.</p><p>"I don’t know. We were friends from day one, and it just grew to more one day." Rubbing at my arms to soothe my crawling skin, I add, "Alpha Brax wasn’t against the relationship. He was fine with it until the Mate Hunt."</p><p>"Of course he was," he mutters, resuming his pacing. "Your mother. She was his mate?"</p><p>"That’s what Alpha Brax told me." My fingers twist in my lap. "But I don’t know anything about her. His mate, I mean. The pack never said a word about her."</p><p>Rafe probably knows... and kept it from me. It’s a depressing thought.</p><p>"There’s probably a rule against it." Caine’s pacing slows, his broad shoulders tight with tension. "Because of his pride."</p><p> </p><p><em>He knows</em>. My heart pounds against my ribs. He knows something. "Do you..." The question sticks in my throat. I swallow hard and force the words past the knot. "Do you know about her? My mother?"</p><p>His jaw works, muscles jumping beneath his skin. "It’s old history. Most in the region would know."</p><p>He’s too busy pacing to look at me, so he probably doesn’t see my face as my heart splinters into jagged pieces. I just want to know more about Mom, to piece this mystery together. Is it so hard to share a few words?</p><p>But he’s the Lycan King, interrogating a prisoner. There’s no reason for him to soothe my injured heart.</p><p>Lowering my head, I stab out another bite of lasagna. "I see."</p><p>Andrew might know something. Maybe during the drive to Sterling City, I can get him talking. It’ll give us something to talk about, anyway. I was already dreading his presence for the ride.</p><p>The pacing stops. A shadow falls over my plate as Caine hovers by my side, towering over me.</p><p>I peek up through my lashes. His brows draw together, creating harsh lines across his forehead as he scowls down at me. "Eat more."</p><p>My fork hovers over the lasagna. "It’s a little hard when you’re standing there watching my every move."</p><p>His frown deepens. The muscle in his jaw ticks once, twice. Finally, a hissing sound escapes through his teeth—not quite a sigh, and more like steam escaping a pressure valve. "I’ll leave you in peace, then."</p><p>A second later, the door slams shut.</p><p>Did I... offend him?</p><p class="box-notification fs-17"> Search the <b>NovelFire.net</b> website on Google to access chapters of novels early and in the highest quality. </p>

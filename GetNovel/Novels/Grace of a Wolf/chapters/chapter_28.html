<h1>Caine: Intervention</h1>
<p><strong>CAINE</strong></p><p> The sweet scent of blueberry muffins has faded, replaced by a more generic odor—body sweat and wolf musk, courtesy of all my subordinates crowding my suite.
</p><p> It shouldn’t infuriate me as much as it does, but I want to smash their heads together for it.
</p><p> I rub at my temple, the dull throb behind my eyes a stark reminder of my lack of sleep. "Stop standing there in silence."
</p><p> They all look at Jack-Eye; he’s clearly been chosen as their spokesperson. The beta clears his throat, stepping forward. "It’s about last night, Alpha."
</p><p> I expected as much. "What about it?"
</p><p> "The death of an Alpha, even one as problematic as Brax, requires proper protocol. The packs will question—"
</p><p> "Let them question."
</p><p> "With respect," Reggie advances to stand beside Jack-Eye, his scarred face twisted in concern, "we’re not questioning your authority. But slaughtering an alpha and half his pack over a mere human—"
</p><p> My fist slams against the table with a sharp crack. "Mere? Are our laws just decoration?"
</p><p> Jack-Eye elbows Reggie in his side, not bothering with discretion. "But there are procedures for this. The other packs will see this as an act of—"
</p><p> "Tyranny. It isn’t like it’s a new opinion." I’ve done worse in the past, when uniting all packs under my rule. Of course, it was a different time then.
</p><p> "High Alpha." Reggie glances at the others and squares his shoulders, facing me once more. "We stand with you. Always. But the whispers have already returned. Not just ’The Mad King’, but now they’re calling you ’The Butcher of Blue Mountain’."
</p><p> Fenris stirs within me, pleased with the titles. He’s been silent since the girl left, resting to recover his strength. <i>A King’s strength is fearsome.</i></p><p> Fighting a sigh, I wave my free hand in the air. "When the delegates arrive, we’ll deal with them."
</p><p> They all share glances, and Jack-Eye groans when their gazes land on him. Shoving his hand through his hair, he snaps, "Caine, this is a problem. Brax had his hand in a lot of fucking cookie jars. There are plenty who might be happy he’s gone, but Blue Mountain isn’t just some backwater pack. They have solid allies within the region. Cowing them alone is easy, but if they decide to gather and rebel against us—"
</p><p> The muscles in my jaw tighten. "What exactly is your point, Beta?"
</p><p> "We need to understand where your mind is at before we move forward." Jack-Eye’s gaze holds mine, unflinching. "You’ve never shied away from violence—none of us have—but this is out of character, even for you. Do you really want to destroy the peace we’ve finally attained? We’ve spent years cleaning up your image. Have your goals changed?"
</p><p> Crossing my arms, I lean back in the wooden chair, studying their faces. Their concern radiates off them in waves, stinking up the room. It’s expected, but irritating.
</p><p> "Brax sealed his fate the moment he showed insolence. An alpha who can’t control his temper has no business leading a pack."
</p><p> Jack-Eye’s eyebrow twitches, and he presses his lips together. I’m sure he has some smartass remark coming, but he’s wise enough to stay silent.
</p><p> Reggie’s throat works, a low growl building as his hands clench at his sides. "We all know this isn’t about his leadership. It’s about that human git."
</p><p><i>Kill him, </i>Fenris demands, outrage pouring into our bond. <i>His disrespect has gone too far.</i></p><p> My tattoos burn with his rage, but I ignore it. Fenris is too sensitive over the girl, and his emotions have clouded my head for too long.
</p><p><i>My emotions? They’re yours, too. The longer it takes for you to accept it, the harder it will be for both of us.</i></p><p> "Humans don’t belong in a strong pack," Reggie continues, his upper lip curling in a snarl. "They’re weak and useless. She’s already proven to be a liability—"
</p><p> "If you’re so hell-bent on following the law," I cut in, my voice dropping to a dangerous whisper, "why are you pestering me about enforcing it?"
</p><p> Dylan, an older Lycan with gray hair and a penchant for smoothing things over, steps forward. Even his face is twisted in a sneer. "Are you really investigating that... thing, Alpha?"
</p><p> The tattoos across my chest burn with a dull ache. Fenris snaps at the air inside me. <i>I’m going for his throat.</i></p><p> I give a lot of leniency to my people in return for their loyalty, but Fenris is another matter—he would have them on the ground and bleeding in a heartbeat to maintain his status in the pack.
</p><p> If he hadn’t used so much energy in the past week, he’d probably manifest on the spot to prove he means what he says. Instead, I’m able to subdue him through force of will, clamping down on our bond until he has no choice but to go silent.
</p><p> Jack-Eye stomps on Reggie’s foot without batting an eyelash, and the resulting grunt helps ease the tightness in my chest. Jack-Eye’s beta domination is a soft whisper in the air, almost a tickle against my skin, but Reggie and Dylan take a step back in unison.
</p><p> Their faces are tight and grim, but at least they’re quiet.
</p><p> "Grace Harper," Jack-Eye says, and my eye twitches to hear her name coming out of his mouth.
</p><p> Even I don’t use her name.
</p><p> "Her name is Grace Harper," he continues, frowning at each Lycan in turn. "Remember it well."
</p><p> Every molecule in my body wants to snap at them to keep her name out of their filthy mouths, and I wonder if Fenris is manipulating my emotions again.
</p><p><i>No, it’s just you.</i></p><p> Jack-Eye, oblivious to the rage simmering in my veins, turns back to me with a frown. "You’re holding her captive when she’s clearly Brax’s victim. Why are we still holding her here? We should be escorting her to the nearest human city."
</p><p>The fire of rage is replaced with ice with his words. My fingers tighten against each armrest, wood splintering beneath the force of my grip. "I am still investigating. There is always the possibility she forced her way into the pack."</p><p> It’s a flimsy excuse, and I know it. They do, too, judging by the way they’re staring at me.
</p><p><i>Just admit it.</i></p><p> "I know Fenris wants her, but it doesn’t seem so one-sided to me. You’re feeling it too, aren’t you?"
</p><p> The other Lycans stir; it’s clear none of them know what Jack-Eye’s implying, and I want it to stay that way. "Enough."
</p><p> But my beta has never been one to respect boundaries. He’s more of a bulldozer than a wolf. "Alpha, is there really a fated connection between you?"
</p><p> "Impossible," Dylan snaps, and the others echo his sentiments.
</p><p> "Humans are unable to form a fated connection," Reggie agrees with a scowl. "Brax tried to claim that human bitch as his fated mate to justify her kidnapping, but in the end it was proven fake, wasn’t it?"
</p><p> "Technically, the Council of Alphas agreed it was impossible to form a consensus," Jack-Eye says, his eyes never leaving mine. "And Fenris has a clear draw toward the human girl. He’s been protecting her this entire time."
</p><p> The room descends into chaos as my Lycans argue among themselves, their growls and voices setting my teeth on edge.
</p><p> "Fated bonds are between wolf souls," Dylan says, pointing in the general direction of the human girl’s room. "She has no wolf. Humans can’t be a fated mate!"
</p><p> Fenris growls, and the burn of my tattoos intensifies. A dull ache spreads across my chest.
</p><p> "High Alpha." Reggie’s voice cuts through the noise. The others fall silent as he steps forward, chin raised in challenge. "We need an answer. Is the human girl truly your fated mate?"
</p><p><i>Tell them,</i> Fenris demands. <i>I’ve already accepted her as ours. Why can’t you?</i></p><p> Scowling, I hold Reggie’s stare, letting out a flare of alpha dominance. It’s enough to take the wind out of his sails, and his chin lowers. "My choice of mate isn’t up for debate."
</p><p><i>You’re avoiding the question again.</i></p><p> "Any delegates who come to protest will be informed that the rightful successor of Blue Mountain Pack remains alive and in power." The words come out from between gritted teeth as I picture that blond pup—tall, muscular, with perfect features. His scent lingers in my memory, wrapped around her like a claim. "The Lycans haven’t seized control, so there should be no issue."
</p><p> "And the human?" Dylan asks.
</p><p> "There are questions that need answers regarding Brax’s decision to harbor a human in his pack. Her role remains... unclear. Until we determine the full scope of this situation, she stays under our protection."
</p><p><i>Liar.</i></p><p> Reggie’s face contorts. "It’s a disgrace for Lycans to guard a human."
</p><p> Murmurs of agreement ripple through the room, the sound grating against my nerves like sandpaper. I felt the same just two days ago, but the memory of her injured wrist has my jaw locking tight enough to crack teeth. The girl needs protection. More than that, she needs to stay locked in her room. For her own safety.
</p><p> "We’ve already assigned Blue Mountain Pack members as her guards so we could all be here," Jack-Eye points out. "They’ve been thoroughly warned about keeping their hands to themselves. We’ll just continue this way."
</p><p> The thought of those wolves—any wolves not under my direct control—near her sets my blood boiling. But my subordinates’ shoulders relax, their faces showing relief at this solution. Sighing, I wave my hand at Jack-Eye. "Do that, then."</p>

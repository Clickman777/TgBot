<h1>Caine: Can I Have My Hand Back?</h1>
<p><strong>CAINE</strong></p><p>The girl’s wrist is so thin and fragile, I’m reasonably certain it would break under the pressure of lifting a gallon of milk.</p><p><em>She’s not that weak.</em></p><p>The bruises on her skin say otherwise, perfectly spaced. Four fingers and a thumb.</p><p>Hmm. How many fingers does a Luna need? She can probably get by with none. In fact, the Blue Mountain Pack has gone years without a Luna; I’m sure they would be just fine without one now...</p><p><em>Oh?</em> Fenris perks up, his mental presence a little stronger. <em>Are we killing her, then?</em></p><p>It’s a tempting thought.</p><p>I take a deep breath of blueberry muffin-scented air, recalling the unknown scent all over her when we first met. My upper lip curls back in a snarl. Better to keep that vicious little Luna alive; she’ll keep her mate in line.</p><p>Fenris hums in the back of my head. <em>Good idea. Or we can kill both of them?</em> His hopeful question is another temptation, but it would only bring forth more headaches in the long run.</p><p>At least without cause.</p><p>"Um..." The girl’s sweet voice interrupts my vengeful train of thought. "...Caine?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"Can I have my hand back?"</p><p>"No." She always seems to be asking for things back, a surprisingly irritating trait.</p><p><em>Jack-Eye, bring me a first-aid kit.</em></p><p>The girl’s grass-green eyes flash dark, but she doesn’t move from her place on the couch. She still smells fearful, but not enough to overpower her ever-present muffin fragrance. Still, judging by the way she avoids meeting my eyes, it’s very clear she’s afraid of me.</p><p>Frowning, I grab her left hand, checking that wrist over. There’s a small bruise, but she seems able to use it freely.</p><p>I don’t miss how she jumps when I grab it, though.</p><p>"Why are you so scared? I’m not going to eat you."</p><p>Her laugh is breathy and artificial, but she still doesn’t meet my gaze. My fingers still circle her delicate wrist, monitoring her pulse as it beats frantically beneath my touch.</p><p>Her laughter dies quickly. "Oh. You’re not being funny."</p><p>"I was being serious. I have no intention of eating you." This assurance should be enough to ease her fear.</p><p>Fenris’s amusement is overpowering through our bond. <em>You’re trying to be nice. How adorable.</em></p><p>Ignoring him, I focus instead on the way her pulse jumps when I brush my thumb across the tender skin of her inner wrist. The sight of her bruises sets my teeth on edge.</p><p>Her eyes dart behind me, before wandering away again. She shifts on the couch, drawing back slightly, but I have no intention of letting her move further away. As soon as she realizes I’m not letting go, she stops. "Well, you killed Alpha Brax. And everyone else."</p><p>"Yes, I did."</p><p> </p><p>"That kind of thing..." Her voice trails off as she stares at my hand on her wrist. "You know, humans call it murder."</p><p>My fingers tighten and the scent of her fear spikes, sharp and acrid. It’s starting to grate on my nerves. I’ve given her no reason to think I’d harm her—quite the opposite, really. I’ve fed her, clothed her, and protected her from that pathetic excuse of an Alpha.</p><p><em>You also chased her, tackled her, tied her up, left her in the forest, choked her...</em></p><p>Point taken. "If I wanted to hurt you, little human, I would have done so in the forest that first night."</p><p><em>You did, though,</em> Fenris chides. <em>Ruined all my progress with her. Now she doesn’t trust either of us.</em></p><p>I’m definitely going to punch him the next time he manifests. He’s a little too comfortable lately.</p><p>"You did hurt me," she says, in an echo of my wolf.</p><p>A growl rips from my throat before I can stop it, and the girl startles.</p><p><em>You’re scaring her again. Also, Jack-Eye’s here.</em></p><p>Jack-Eye’s scent precedes him as he enters, first aid kit in hand. He doesn’t bat an eye at our relocation to the couch, but I can smell his curiosity.</p><p>While we all showed solidarity last night, none the Lycans I brought with me agree with the actions I took last night. The political headache alone doesn’t seem worth it, and I have to admit they have a point.</p><p>I snatch the kit from him, finally dropping the girl’s injured wrist. The white gauze roll feels rough against my fingers as I pull it out, very different from her soft, delicate skin.</p><p>"Hold still," I command, wrapping the bandage around her wrist. She doesn’t resist, but her eyes track my every movement.</p><p>Her scent shifts—less fear now, more confusion. The bruises disappear beneath clean white layers as I work.</p><p><em>Take her back to her room,</em> I order Jack-Eye through our pack link. <em>And make sure nothing like this happens again. No one touches her.</em></p><p> </p><p>Jack-Eye frowns at the girl’s gauze-wrapped hand. <em>Didn’t think a simple grab would do that much damage, honestly.</em></p><p>"Jack-Eye will take you back to your room. Try not to get in trouble on your way there."</p><p>The girl tests her bandaged wrist with careful movements. A small wince crosses her face, and she lets it rest in her lap. Her eyes drift past my shoulder, toward my bedroom door.</p><p>"Is that..." She points with her good hand. "Is that my pillow?"</p><p>My spine stiffens. Heat crawls up my neck as I recall the soft bundle lying haphazardly over my comforter, still radiating her scent.</p><p>Jack-Eye clears his throat beside me. His face remains neutral, but the sharp tang of amusement floods my nostrils. That bastard. I’ll make him run laps until his legs fall off.</p><p>"No." The denial comes out too quick, but she doesn’t seem to realize it.</p><p>"Oh." She bites her lower lip. "Could I maybe have my pillow back, though? It was my only one."</p><p>"You’ll get a new one." I wave my hand dismissively, refusing to acknowledge the burning in my ears. "Jack-Eye, take her. Now."</p><p>Jack-Eye’s amusement spikes higher as he gestures for the girl to follow him.</p><p><em>I didn’t think you’d be quite this hopeless,</em> Fenris sighs. <em>At least learn how to talk to her.</em></p><p>"Shut up," I growl under my breath, watching them leave. The pillow’s scent is a weak echo of her warm blueberry scent, but I’m still not going to give it back. She can have a dozen new ones for all I care.</p><p class="box-notification fs-17"> Search the <b>NovelFire.net</b> website on Google to access chapters of novels early and in the highest quality. </p>
